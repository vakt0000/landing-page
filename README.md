#What have I learnt?
In this project I have learnt how to apply the knowledge about placing and dealing correctly with layout in css. I have used flex to properly display the elements. An useful property is the "flex-wrap: wrap" which manages with ease the resizing of the page. It was a simple project but very useful to test my skills.
